# Predicting Newsletter Subscription on the PLAI Minecraft Research Server

This repository contains the complete, reproducible workflow for a data-science
project that predicts whether a player on the **PLAI** (Programming Languages
for Artificial Intelligence) Minecraft research server will opt in to the
game-related newsletter.  
All analysis lives in a single Jupyter (R-kernel) notebook and follows the
usual data science pipeline:

1. data loading & cleaning  
2. exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
3. feature engineering  
4. single predictor screening  
5. forward selection modelling (k-NN)  
6. discussion & future work
